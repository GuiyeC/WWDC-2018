 We've seen the basic implementation of a Genetic Algorithm:
 * Generate a random population.
 * **Evaluate** each individual.
 * **Select** a new population.
 * **Cross** individuals from the new population.
 * **Mutate** to add variety.
 * And **repeat**.

 Repeat as much as we want, until we find the optiomal solution or at least one we are happy with.

 With the basics down, let's get into real life applications of the Genetic Algorithm. Genetic Algorithms can be used to calculate class schedules, get the best times to go grocery shopping, create the best antennas or airplane wings possible...
 
 We are gonna look at a well known problem,  the **Travelling Salesman Problem** or TSP for short.

 You are a salesman and you want to visit a number of cities before returning to your hometown, and you want to travel the shortest distance possible.
 
 This might look like a really simple problem, you might just pick the map and try to find the route yourself, but, how will you know if it's the best route? It might be easy to check if you only want to visit 3 cities, but it gets impossible when you try to visit 20 for example.

 You can play around as much as you like with this code, it has a completely new individual, a ```Tour``` with a ```Route``` as it's genotype. We can no longer use the same crossover and mutation algorithms, we don't want to repeat cities in our genotypes. Take that into account and most importantly, have fun!
